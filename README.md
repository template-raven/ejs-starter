<h1 align="center"> EJS Starter </h1>

Writing express boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote this.

EJS Starter Template is a boilerplate for new Node.js applications with the help of [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [EJS](https://ejs.co). The idea behind this project is to have everything in place, so there are no extra dependencies and you can focus on building your application.

EJS Starter is the best way to kick off your next Node.js project. This boilerplate has everything you need to get started.
